GOYA TOKEN CONTRACT

## Overview

The GOYA token contract is a Solidity smart contract designed for creating and managing the GOYA token on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract includes functions for minting new tokens and burning existing tokens, providing basic functionality for managing token balances and total supply.

## Description

The GOYA token contract is used to deploy the GOYA token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to mint new tokens, increasing the total supply, and burn existing tokens, decreasing the total supply. This contract is essential for managing the issuance and circulation of the GOYA token, providing a foundation for various decentralized applications (DApps) and financial transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Installing

To use the GOYA token contract, you can deploy it to an Ethereum-compatible network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Rinkeby testnet) using a compatible development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle). No modifications are needed to the contract itself for basic functionality.

## Executing Program

1. Deploy the GOYA token contract to an Ethereum-compatible network.
2. Use the `mint` function to create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.
3. Use the `burn` function to destroy existing tokens and reduce the total supply.

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. Deploy the contract using a deployment tool or framework.
2. Use the deployed contract address to interact with the contract using a web3-enabled application or script.
3. Call the `mint` function with the desired address and token amount to create new tokens.
4. Call the `burn` function with the desired address and token amount to destroy tokens.

## Help

- Ensure proper access control to prevent unauthorized minting or burning of tokens.
- Use appropriate testing and auditing before deploying to a live network.
